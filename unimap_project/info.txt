write a script that automatically load your json data collected before admin can add extra
of new buildings data.
impliment the add delete and update for superusers
impliment an algorithm that calculate the shortest path on your map

impliment your tests before moving to the mobile apps make sure the backend is ok
including the apis test from heigit

problems:
1) my street map is poor i can't even see my buildings (find out is was some of the theme)
almost fixed

2) build the models and your searilizers
done


api used:
1)  Heigit "heidelberg institute for geoinformation technology" 
    login; sedrickbodeh654@gmail.com  mypass"private"
  ((check out all the endpoint allot you can improve your map))

  having a problem error saying that i should check my api that count draw route
  can not draw route from oned building to the other

  then a problem with my live location it its not accurate at times it show at two
  different spot on the map. this is with the first map campus_map
  if the second map is not that good use the green theme from the first map 
  and update it into the second map


after all also remember to get data for the remainding building like where you will pass your form a

ideal base on the style for the featurer
when like the the box that shows the info about the hall when tap on
it can improve to drop up and showing details like select the hall. move from this hall to 
that hall the on the map the direction is drawn 
the map offline if posible


build it in such a way that when the user is not in the current location (school area)
let him know just like in the princtons univecity map
lasly impliment offline cash so students can view direction without intenet
add a back door for your app like if someone steal it how can u still get in. hack it

before hosting make sure all important info is store in the backend

secure the api ey using .env: using settings.py for now

add a cathe to easily acess repeated routes: done catch for 10min



how can it support another language for your francophone mates (english and french)
can the broswer do that for me ?
